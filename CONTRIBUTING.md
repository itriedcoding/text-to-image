## üíª Code Contributions

Ready to dive into the code? Here's how to get started:

### Setup Your Development Environment

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/your-username/gemini-ai-imagecrafter.git).
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-ai-imagecrafter.git
    cd gemini-ai-imagecrafter
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.)
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
4.  **Configure Google Gemini API Key:**
    The application expects your Google Gemini API Key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. You will need to set this environment variable before running the development server.
    
    **Example (Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    npx serve .
    ```
    (Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual key.)

5.  **Run the Application:** As this is a client-side ES module application, you can serve it with a static server:
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    # or http-server . if you have it installed globally
    ```
    Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port reported by the server).
6.  **Create a New Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    # or bugfix/your-bugfix-name
    ```

### Code Style

*   **ESLint and Prettier:** We use ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. Ensure your code adheres to these standards. Configuration files (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`) are included in the repository.
*   **TypeScript:** All new code should be written in TypeScript, following existing patterns and type definitions.
*   **Accessibility:** Prioritize accessibility (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML) in all UI changes.
*   **Responsiveness:** Ensure UI changes are responsive and work well across different screen sizes.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix.
2.  **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your code to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce new bugs.
3.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages. (See "Commit Message Guidelines" below).
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature for X"
    ```
4.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the original GitHub repository.
    *   You should see a prompt to open a PR from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining what it does, why it's needed, and any relevant context.
    *   Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`).

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps us generate release notes and understand the history more easily.

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

*   **type:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`
*   **scope (optional):** Component, page, or area affected (e.g., `generatePage`, `navbar`, `geminiService`).

**Examples:**
